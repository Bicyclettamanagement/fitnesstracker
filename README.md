# FitnessTracker
The fitness tracker application is a console application that allows users to track their fitness activities, create workout plans, and measure their progress over time. It is designed to help people achieve their fitness goals and live a healthy life. The application allows users to perform various exercises and record repetitions and weights. Users can add new exercises, create workout plans. From a user perspective, the application provides an interactive console interface through which users can interact with the application. They can register, log in, select exercises, enter the number of repetitions and weight, and save the data. The application also displays information about exercises already performed and their progress, allowing users to track their workout progress. The fitness tracker application solves the problem of manually tracking and recording fitness activities. Instead of writing everything down on paper or in separate notes, users can store their exercises and progress conveniently and centrally in the application. This allows for better organization, analysis and tracking of fitness activities over time. The application thus promotes structured and effective training, while helping users stay motivated and achieve their goals.
